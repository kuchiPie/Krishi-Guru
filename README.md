# Hackverse 4.0 HACK PROJECT -- KRISHI GURU (by Team Billboards)

Creating an AI-powered mobile application for Indian farmers would provide them with easy access to accurate information about weather forecasts and agricultural-related queries. This is important because agriculture is a major industry in India, employing a large portion of the population and contributing significantly to the country's economy. However, farmers in India face numerous challenges, such as unpredictable weather patterns, pests, and diseases, which can impact their yields and income.


By providing an AI-powered mobile application that allows farmers to ask queries about weather forecasts and other agricultural-related issues, farmers can make more informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and other farming practices. For example, they can use the information to decide when to plant their crops, how much water to use, and when to harvest their crops. This can help them optimize their yields and reduce losses due to weather-related risks.


Moreover, the mobile application can also provide personalized advice to farmers based on their specific needs and circumstances. For instance, it can recommend crop varieties that are best suited to their soil type and provide guidance on pest and disease management. This can help farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers and adopt more sustainable farming practices.


In summary, creating an AI-powered mobile application for Indian farmers can provide them with valuable information and support to improve their farming practices, increase their yields, and ultimately contribute to the growth of India's agricultural industry.
