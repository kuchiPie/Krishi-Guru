mango_text = """
The mango tree is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, which also includes cashews and pistachios. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 100 feet tall, although most cultivated trees are smaller and more manageable. Mango trees produce a large, oval-shaped fruit that is typically 3-10 inches long and weighs anywhere from 6 ounces to 4 pounds, depending on the variety.

Mangoes are a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, and E, as well as potassium, magnesium, and fiber. They are also high in antioxidants, which help to protect the body against oxidative stress and inflammation. The flesh of the mango is rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body and is important for maintaining healthy vision, skin, and mucous membranes.

One of the unique qualities of the mango is its aroma, which is caused by a group of volatile compounds called terpenes. The most abundant of these is myrcene, which is also found in hops and is responsible for the characteristic aroma of beer. Other terpenes found in mangoes include alpha-pinene, limonene, and beta-caryophyllene, all of which contribute to the fruit's complex flavor and fragrance.

Mangoes are typically eaten fresh, either on their own or in salads and other dishes. They are also used in a variety of culinary applications, including chutneys, smoothies, and desserts. In many countries, mangoes are an important ingredient in traditional dishes, such as mango sticky rice in Thailand and aamras in India.

India is the largest producer of mangoes in the world, accounting for over 40% of global production. Other major producers include China, Thailand, Mexico, and Indonesia. There are hundreds of different varieties of mangoes, each with its own unique flavor and texture. Some of the most popular varieties include Alphonso, Ataulfo, Haden, Keitt, and Tommy Atkins.

Despite their popularity and nutritional value, mangoes can be difficult to grow and harvest. The trees are sensitive to frost and require warm, humid conditions to thrive. They also require careful pruning and maintenance to ensure proper growth and fruit production. In addition, mangoes can be difficult to harvest, as the fruit must be picked at the right time to ensure optimal flavor and ripeness.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the health benefits of mangoes, particularly their potential to improve digestion, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation. Some studies have also suggested that mangoes may have anti-cancer properties, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.

cotton_text = """
There are many pests that can affect cotton growth, development, and yield. Some of the most important ones include:

Boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis)
The boll weevil is a small beetle that feeds on cotton buds, flowers, and bolls. Its feeding activity can lead to significant yield losses and a reduction in cotton fiber quality. Boll weevil infestation is usually controlled by using pheromone traps, insecticides, and cultural practices such as crop rotation and planting of resistant cotton varieties.

Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii)
Cotton aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that feed on cotton leaves and flowers. They can cause leaf yellowing, curling, and deformation, reducing the photosynthetic capacity of the plant and leading to yield losses. Cotton aphid control can be achieved through the use of insecticides, cultural practices, and natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and ladybird beetles.

Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera)
The cotton bollworm is a major pest of cotton that feeds on cotton buds, flowers, and bolls. Its feeding activity can lead to boll rot, boll shedding, and yield losses. Cotton bollworm control can be achieved through the use of insecticides, cultural practices, and natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory bugs.

Spider mites (Tetranychus spp.)
Spider mites are tiny arthropods that feed on cotton leaves and cause leaf yellowing, stippling, and shedding. They can lead to significant yield losses if not controlled in time. Spider mite control can be achieved through the use of miticides, cultural practices, and natural enemies such as predatory mites.

Cotton diseases

Cotton is also susceptible to various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Some of the most important cotton diseases include:

Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum)
Fusarium wilt is a fungal disease that affects the vascular system of cotton plants and leads to wilting, yellowing, and death. It can cause significant yield losses and affect cotton fiber quality. Fusarium wilt control can be achieved through the use of resistant cotton varieties, crop rotation, and fungicides.

Cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV)
Cotton leaf curl virus is a viral disease that is transmitted by whiteflies and affects cotton plants' growth and development. It can lead to stunted growth, leaf curling, and yield losses. Cotton leaf curl virus control can be achieved through the use of insecticides, resistant cotton varieties, and cultural practices such as the removal of virus-infected plants.

Alternaria leaf spot (Alternaria macrospora)
Alternaria leaf spot is a fungal disease that affects cotton leaves and leads to leaf spots, yellowing, and defoliation. It can cause significant yield losses if not controlled in time. Alternaria leaf spot control can be achieved through the use of resistant cotton varieties, crop rotation, and fungicides.

Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae)
Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that affects the vascular system of cotton plants and leads to wilting, yellowing, and death. It can cause significant yield losses and affect cotton fiber quality. Verticillium wilt control can be achieved through the use of resistant cotton varieties, crop rotation
"""

wheat_text = """
Wheat crops are susceptible to more than 30 diseases caused by fungi, viruses, and bacteria, which can significantly affect the crop's health, yield, and grain quality. To prevent pests and diseases, farmers should consider the following measures:

Invest in prevention measures, especially for bacteria and viruses.
Use resistant or tolerant varieties, preferably with resistance to the prevalent pathogen variants in the area.
Use healthy, disease and pest-free, clean, and certified seeds.
Implement crop rotation, ideally with species-crops having different "enemies" or are resistant to the most important wheat pest and diseases.
Keep the field weed-free and deal with crop residues.
Keep plants vigorous, avoiding water stress and nutrient deficiencies.
Scout fields regularly, especially during periods with favorable environmental conditions for infection and dispersal.
Know the "enemy's" physiology, the favorable environmental conditions for its growth, and the ways and rhythm of dispersal.
Act fast and with precision when recognizing diseases at an early stage.
Have a planned in-crop fungicide regime, knowing which pathogens or pests in the area have developed resistance to specific active compounds.
The most common early-season foliar diseases affecting wheat crops are powdery mildew and Septoria leaf spot. Powdery mildew is caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici and is favored by cool and wet weather conditions. Symptoms appear as yellow flecks on leaves that later are covered with fluffy white powder. Septoria leaf spot is caused by the pathogen Septoria tritici, and the most common symptom is elongated chlorotic lesion-spots on the leaves. Resistant varieties and fungicide application are effective measures against both diseases. Rust is also a significant threat to wheat crops caused by Puccinia species, leading to significant yield losses, reduced grain quality, and other problems.

the disease is prevalent during June-September.
In Western and Central India (rainfall around

plants and apply additional
nitrogen for early recovery.
 Incorporate Phorate 10 G @ 12-
15 kg/ha or Fipronil 0.4 G @ 25

sprouted seeds. If such
incorporation is not possible,
broadcast the recommended
insecticides 4-5 days after
