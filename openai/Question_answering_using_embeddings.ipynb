    "# Question answering using embeddings-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT excels at answering questions, but only on topics it remembers from its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do if you want GPT to answer questions about unfamiliar topics? E.g.,\n",
    "- Recent events after Sep 2021\n",
    "- Your non-public documents\n",
    "- Information from past conversations\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search:** search your library of text for relevant text sections\n",

    "## Why search is better than fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\n",
    "- Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model           | Maximum text length       |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | 4,096 tokens (~5 pages)   |\n",
    "| `gpt-4`         | 8,192 tokens (~10 pages)  |\n",
    "| `gpt-4-32k`     | 32,768 tokens (~40 pages) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.\n"

    "## Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical-based search\n",
    "- Graph-based search\n",
    "- Embedding-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook uses embedding-based search. [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may be also be improved with techniques like [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."

    "## Full procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare search data (once)\n",
    "    1. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n",
    "    2. Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n",
    "    3. Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n",
    "    4. Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\n",
    "2. Search (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    2. Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",
    "3. Ask (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n",
    "    2. Return GPT's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a high volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gpt-3.5-turbo` using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "- For `gpt-4`, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns."

Powdery mildew is caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici and is favored by cool and wet weather conditions. Symptoms appear as yellow flecks on leaves that later are covered with fluffy white powder. Septoria leaf spot is caused by the pathogen Septoria tritici, and the most common symptom is elongated chlorotic lesion-spots on the leaves. Resistant varieties and fungicide application are effective measures against both diseases. Rust is also a significant threat to wheat crops caused by Puccinia species, leading to significant yield losses, reduced grain quality, and other problems.\n",

    "The mango tree is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, which also includes cashews and pistachios. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 100 feet tall, although most cultivated trees are smaller and more manageable. Mango trees produce a large, oval-shaped fruit that is typically 3-10 inches long and weighs anywhere from 6 ounces to 4 pounds, depending on the variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mangoes are a rich source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, and E, as well as potassium, magnesium, and fiber. They are also high in antioxidants, which help to protect the body against oxidative stress and inflammation. The flesh of the mango is rich in beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body and is important for maintaining healthy vision, skin, and mucous membranes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the unique qualities of the mango is its aroma, which is caused by a group of volatile compounds called terpenes. The most abundant of these is myrcene, which is also found in hops and is responsible for the characteristic aroma of beer. Other terpenes found in mangoes include alpha-pinene, limonene, and beta-caryophyllene, all of which contribute to the fruit's complex flavor and fragrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mangoes are typically eaten fresh, either on their own or in salads and other dishes. They are also used in a variety of culinary applications, including chutneys, smoothies, and desserts. In many countries, mangoes are an important ingredient in traditional dishes, such as mango sticky rice in Thailand and aamras in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "India is the largest producer of mangoes in the world, accounting for over 40% of global production. Other major producers include China, Thailand, Mexico, and Indonesia. There are hundreds of different varieties of mangoes, each with its own unique flavor and texture. Some of the most popular varieties include Alphonso, Ataulfo, Haden, Keitt, and Tommy Atkins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their popularity and nutritional value, mangoes can be difficult to grow and harvest. The trees are sensitive to frost and require warm, humid conditions to thrive. They also require careful pruning and maintenance to ensure proper growth and fruit production. In addition, mangoes can be difficult to harvest, as the fruit must be picked at the right time to ensure optimal flavor and ripeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been growing interest in the health benefits of mangoes, particularly their potential to improve digestion, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation. Some studies have also suggested that mangoes may have anti-cancer properties, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n",

Frass is one of the main products from commercial black soldier fly rearing. The chemical profile of the frass varies with the substrate the larvae feed on. However in general it is considered a versatile organic plant fertilizer due to a favorable ratio of three major plant nutrients [[NPK|Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium.]] The frass is commonly applied by direct mixing with soil and considered a long-term fertilizer with slow nutrient release.   Next to its nutrient provision the frass can carry further components that are beneficial for soil fertility and soil health. One of them is the soil improver chitin \\n\\nIt is an ongoing debate whether the frass from black soldier fly larvae rearing can be used as a fertilizer in a fresh state or has to undergo further composting before its application. There are assumptions that further composting would lead to the reduction of potential [[Phytotoxicity|phytotoxic]] properties.

The warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either winter or spring types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become dormant during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season. Winter varieties do not flower until springtime because they need vernalization: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.'"

In 1959, O'Farrell represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to [[Armoy, County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]. He later attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, [[Rome]], Italy in 1960, where he presented a block of [[Kilkenny Marble]] as Ireland's contribution to Rome's 'Cairn of Peace'. During O'Farrell's tenure in office,  he representing Ireland at the 9th (1961) World Ploughing Contest, at [[Thiverval-Grignon]] in France. He was officially introduced to President of the French Republic, [[Charles De Gaulle]]. Also in 1961, the Ploughing Championships (at Killarney) were filmed for the first time by RTÉ. It was filmed on 8 and 9 November 1961 and broadcast in the first ever episode of the farming programme 'On the Land', on 1 January 1962. The film was notable in that it was broadcast the day after [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Teilifís Éireann]] first went on air.\n",

      "In 1964, the NPA sent two competitors to Fuchsenbigl, near [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where Ireland won their first World Title when Charlie Keegan, from [[County Wicklow]], was the winner. Arriving home from the world contest in Vienna, the Wicklow man was welcomed home to [[Enniskerry]], [[County Wicklow]] on an open top bus and met by bonfires along the roadside as they greeted NPA's first World Ploughing Champion. The [[Irish Times]] reported how the tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 had now been restored. It was a green Deutz D40L tractor that was restored to its original condition by his grandson.\n",

In 1966, a new competition was introduced to cater for students from the agricultural colleges. In 1969, the [[Irish Countrywomen's Association]] (ICA) were invited to give demonstrations in cookery and crafts. O'Farrell held the position of MD until his death in 1972. The [[Kilkenny People]], in their September 1972 obituary, recorded that he was NPA Managing Director and a member of World Ploughing Organisation and that the graveside oration was delivered by [[Seán Ó Síocháin]], General Secretary of [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]].{{fact|date=December 2020}}\n",
